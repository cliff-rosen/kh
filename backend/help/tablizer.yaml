      AI columns let you analyze articles with custom criteria.

      **Adding an AI Column:**
      1. Click "Add AI Column"
      2. Enter a column name
      3. Choose the output type
      4. Write your criteria or question
      5. Click "Add"

      The AI processes each article and populates the column with results.

      **Column Types:**

      **Boolean (Yes/No)**
      Ask yes/no questions. Results show as colored badges.
      Examples:
      - "Is this a clinical trial?"
      - "Does this study involve human subjects?"
      - "Is this about [specific drug or condition]?"

      **Text**
      Extract specific information from each article.
      Examples:
      - "What is the study design?"
      - "What population was studied?"
      - "What is the primary endpoint?"
      - "Summarize the main finding in one sentence"

      **Number**
      Extract numeric values.
      Examples:
      - "What is the sample size?"
      - "How many months of follow-up?"

      Each AI column result includes:

      **The Value:**
      - Boolean: Yes or No (shown as colored badge)
      - Text: The extracted information
      - Number: The numeric value

      **Confidence Score:**
      How confident the AI is in its answer (0-100%).
      - High confidence: AI found clear evidence
      - Low confidence: Answer is uncertain or inferred

      **Reasoning:**
      The AI's explanation for its answer.
      - Toggle visibility with the chat bubble icon in the column header
      - Hover over a cell to see reasoning in a tooltip
      - Exported CSV includes reasoning for each row

      **Tips:**
      - Check reasoning when confidence is low
      - Boolean columns are most reliable for filtering
      - Text columns work best with specific, focused questions

      Tablizer provides multiple ways to narrow down articles.

      **Text Search:**
      Use the search box to filter across all visible columns.
      Matches title, journal, abstract, AI summary, and AI column values.

      **Boolean Quick Filters:**
      When you add a Boolean AI column, quick filter buttons appear:
      - **All** - Show all articles
      - **Yes** - Show only articles where the AI answered "Yes"
      - **No** - Show only articles where the AI answered "No"

      Multiple Boolean columns can be filtered simultaneously.

      **Column Sorting:**
      Click any column header to sort:
      - First click: Sort ascending
      - Second click: Sort descending
      - Third click: Clear sort

      **Column Visibility:**
      Click "Columns" to show/hide specific columns.
      Hidden columns are still searchable.

      Export your analysis for use in other tools.

      **Export CSV:**
      Click "Export" to download a CSV file containing:
      - All visible columns
      - All filtered rows (or all rows if no filter active)
      - AI column values with confidence and reasoning

      **Copy IDs:**
      Click "Copy X IDs" to copy PMIDs of filtered articles to clipboard.
      Useful for searching in PubMed or other tools.

      **What's Included in Export:**
      For each AI column, the CSV includes three columns:
      - The value (Yes/No, text, or number)
      - Confidence percentage
      - Reasoning explanation

      **Tips:**
      - Apply filters before exporting to get specific subsets
      - Use Boolean AI columns to identify articles of interest, then export just those
      - Text AI columns pre-extract information you'd otherwise need to read for manually
