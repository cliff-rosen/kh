      Tablizer uses standard PubMed query syntax for searching.

      **Basic Search:**
      Enter keywords or phrases to search across titles, abstracts, and MeSH terms.

      **Advanced Syntax:**
      - `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` - Boolean operators
      - `"phrase"` - Exact phrase matching
      - `[ti]` - Search title only
      - `[au]` - Search author
      - `[mh]` - Search MeSH terms
      - `[pt]` - Publication type

      **Examples:**
      - `asbestos AND mesothelioma`
      - `"lung cancer"[ti] AND treatment`
      - `Smith J[au] AND 2023[dp]`

      **Date Filters:**
      Use the date filter controls to limit by:
      - Publication date
      - Entry date (when added to PubMed)

      **Results:**
      - Initial search returns ~20 articles quickly
      - Adding AI columns fetches up to 500 for analysis

      AI columns let you analyze articles with custom criteria.

      **Adding an AI Column:**
      1. Click "Add AI Column"
      2. Choose column type
      3. Enter your criteria/question
      4. Optionally enable "Show reasoning"
      5. Click "Add"

      **Column Types:**

      **Boolean (Yes/No)**
      Best for filtering. Examples:
      - "Is this a clinical trial?"
      - "Does this study involve human subjects?"
      - "Is this about drug X?"

      After adding, use Yes/No toggle buttons to filter.

      **Text**
      Extract specific information. Examples:
      - "What is the study design?"
      - "Summarize the main finding in one sentence"
      - "What population was studied?"

      **Number**
      Extract numeric values. Examples:
      - "What is the sample size?"
      - "How many months of follow-up?"

      **Tips:**
      - Be specific in your criteria
      - Boolean columns are most useful for filtering
      - "Show reasoning" helps understand AI decisions

      The History panel tracks your searches and enables powerful comparisons.

      **History Panel:**
      - Every search is automatically saved
      - Click a past search to view those results
      - Delete old searches you no longer need

      **Compare Mode:**
      Select two searches to compare and see:
      - **Intersection** - Articles in both searches
      - **Only in A** - Articles unique to first search
      - **Only in B** - Articles unique to second search

      **Use Case: Finding False Negatives**
      A common workflow for validating search strategies:

      1. Run your original query (Query A)
      2. Run a broader alternative (Query B)
      3. Compare A vs B
      4. Check "Only in B" for relevant articles A missed
      5. If you find relevant articles, refine Query A

      This helps ensure your search strategy isn't missing important literature.
