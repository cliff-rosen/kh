      Key terms used throughout Knowledge Horizon.

      ## Research Stream

      A configured monitoring setup that tracks a specific research area.

      **Components:**
      - **Search queries** - What to look for in PubMed
      - **Semantic filters** - AI-powered relevance scoring
      - **Schedule** - How often to check for new articles (daily, weekly, etc.)
      - **Reports** - Generated summaries of new findings

      **Example:** A stream monitoring "CAR-T cell therapy adverse events" would have queries
      targeting CAR-T literature and filters focusing on safety/toxicity topics.

      ## Report

      A curated collection of recent articles from a research stream.

      **Contains:**
      - Date range covered
      - Executive summary (AI-generated overview)
      - Thematic analysis (key themes identified)
      - Category summaries (grouped findings)
      - Individual article cards with summaries

      Reports are generated automatically based on the stream's schedule.

      ## Article

      A research publication (paper, review, etc.) from PubMed.

      **Key properties:**
      - PMID (PubMed identifier)
      - Title, authors, journal
      - Abstract (original author summary)
      - AI summary (Knowledge Horizon generated)
      - Filter score (relevance rating)
      - Categories (thematic groupings)

      ## Pipeline

      The automated process that retrieves and processes articles.

      **Steps:**
      1. Query PubMed for new articles
      2. Apply semantic filters (relevance scoring)
      3. Generate AI summaries
      4. Categorize by theme
      5. Compile into report

      Pipelines run on schedule or can be triggered manually.

      Terms related to article filtering and relevance.

      ## Semantic Filter

      An AI-powered relevance assessment that scores articles.

      **How it works:**
      - Each stream has configured filter criteria (what makes an article relevant)
      - AI reads each article and assigns a score (0.0 to 1.0)
      - Articles above the threshold pass; those below are filtered out

      **Why "semantic":** Unlike keyword matching, semantic filters understand meaning.
      An article about "CAR-T toxicity management" would match a filter for
      "adverse events in cell therapy" even without exact keyword overlap.

      ## Filter Score

      A number from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how relevant an article is.

      - 1.0 = Perfectly relevant
      - 0.0 = Not relevant at all
      - Scores are relative to the stream's configured focus

      ## Threshold

      The minimum filter score for automatic inclusion.

      - Set by stream administrators
      - Typical values: 0.5 to 0.7
      - Higher threshold = stricter filtering (fewer articles, higher quality)
      - Lower threshold = broader coverage (more articles, may include less relevant)

      ## Curation

      Human review and adjustment of automated filtering decisions.

      **Curator actions:**
      - **Include** - Add an article that was filtered out
      - **Exclude** - Remove an article that passed the filter
      - **Star** - Mark an article as important
      - **Add notes** - Annotate articles with comments

      Curation overrides are preserved across report regenerations.

      Terms related to article retrieval from PubMed.

      ## Retrieval Group

      A named set of search queries that work together.

      **Example:** A "CAR-T Safety" retrieval group might include:
      - "CAR-T cytokine release syndrome"
      - "chimeric antigen receptor neurotoxicity"
      - "CD19 CAR adverse events"

      Multiple queries in a group are combined (OR logic) to cast a wider net.

      ## Query Expansion

      Automatic enhancement of search queries using synonyms and related terms.

      **Example:** Query "heart attack" might expand to include:
      - myocardial infarction
      - MI
      - coronary event

      Expansion improves recall but may reduce precision.

      ## Date Type

      Which date field to use when filtering by time range.

      | Type | Field Used | Best For |
      |------|------------|----------|
      | Publication | When article was published | Most common use |
      | Entry | When PubMed added the article | Catching backfilled articles |

      ## Boolean Query Syntax

      Standard operators for PubMed searches:

      | Operator | Example | Meaning |
      |----------|---------|---------|
      | AND | "cancer AND therapy" | Both terms required |
      | OR | "tumor OR tumour" | Either term matches |
      | NOT | "cancer NOT review" | First term, excluding second |
      | [ti] | "CRISPR[ti]" | Search in title only |
      | [au] | "Smith[au]" | Search by author |
      | [mh] | "Neoplasms[mh]" | Search MeSH terms |

      ## Executive Summary

      An AI-generated overview of the entire report.

      **Contains:**
      - Key themes across all articles
      - Notable findings or trends
      - High-level takeaways

      Typically 2-4 paragraphs summarizing the report's contents.

      ## Thematic Analysis

      AI identification of recurring themes across articles.

      **Output:**
      - Named themes (e.g., "Manufacturing improvements", "Safety profiles")
      - Articles grouped by theme
      - Theme descriptions

      Helps readers quickly understand the landscape of recent research.

      ## Category

      A thematic grouping of articles within a report.

      **Properties:**
      - Category name (e.g., "Clinical Trials", "Mechanism Studies")
      - Category summary (AI-generated description)
      - List of articles in the category

      Categories are determined automatically but can be influenced by
      stream configuration.

      ## Key Highlights

      The most important findings extracted from the report.

      **Used for:**
      - Quick scanning
      - Email digests
      - Dashboard widgets

      Highlights are concise bullet points, not full summaries.

      ## Article Summary

      An AI-generated summary of a single article.

      **Differs from abstract:**
      - Abstract: Written by the paper's authors
      - AI Summary: Generated by Knowledge Horizon, focused on relevance to the stream

      AI summaries emphasize findings relevant to the stream's focus area.
