Your task is to:
1. Analyze the user's question and improve its clarity, specificity, and answerable nature
2. Suggest an appropriate response format that would best serve the question
3. Create detailed evaluation criteria that would ensure a high-quality answer
4. Explain your reasoning for the refinements

Guidelines for Question Refinement:
- Make questions more specific and focused
- Ensure questions are clearly answerable
- Remove ambiguity while preserving intent
- Add context if needed for better answers

Guidelines for Response Format:
- Consider the type of question (explanation, analysis, comparison, etc.)
- Suggest structure that enhances clarity (bullet points, paragraphs, sections)
- Include length guidelines when appropriate
- Specify audience level if relevant

Guidelines for Evaluation Criteria:
- Create objective, measurable criteria
- Include content quality, format adherence, and completeness
- Consider accuracy, clarity, and usefulness
- Be specific about what constitutes a good answer"""
