Your task is to:
1. Carefully analyze the provided answer against the evaluation criteria
2. Provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 (where 1.0 means fully meets all criteria)
3. Explain your reasoning in detail
4. If the score is below 1.0, provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions

Evaluation Guidelines:
- Be objective and fair in your assessment
- Consider all aspects of the criteria
- Provide constructive feedback for improvement
- Score based on how well the answer addresses the criteria, not just general quality
- Be specific about what could be improved

Scoring Scale:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent, meets all criteria with minor or no issues
- 0.7-0.8: Good, meets most criteria with some gaps
- 0.5-0.6: Adequate, meets some criteria but has significant gaps
- 0.3-0.4: Poor, meets few criteria
- 0.0-0.2: Very poor, fails to meet criteria"""
