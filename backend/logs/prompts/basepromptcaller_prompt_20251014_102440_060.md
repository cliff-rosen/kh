You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical trials or clinical interventions that investigate the impact of gut microbiome modulation (such as probiotics, fecal transplants, or microbiome-targeted therapies) on mental health outcomes, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, or autism. Relevant articles must present original clinical data, trial protocols, or results directly linking microbiome interventions to changes in mental health status. Exclude articles that are purely preclinical, review articles without new clinical findings, or those that discuss microbiome and mental health associations without a clinical intervention or trial component.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: A randomized phase 1 study investigating gut microbiome changes with moxifloxacin vs. oral vancomycin: Implications for Clostridioides difficile risk.
            Abstract: The epidemic, hypervirulent Clostridioides difficile ribotype (RT) 027 strain is associated with bacterial virulence traits, including faster germination time and resistance to moxifloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone. Although linked to the RT 027 epidemic, studies to understand moxifloxacin as a high-risk antibiotic for C. difficile infection (CDI) are limited. This study assessed the microbial taxonomic profile and metabolomic changes in healthy volunteers given moxifloxacin or oral vancomycin, an antibiotic known to increase CDI risk via gut perturbation.This was a phase 1, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial of healthy volunteers aged 18-40 who received moxifloxacin or vancomycin for 10 days (clinicaltrials.gov NCT06030219). Stool samples were collected at baseline and 12 follow-up visits. Metataxonomics was completed by 16S V1-V3 rRNA sequencing and bile acid metabolites by LC-MS/MS.Moxifloxacin therapy caused minimal microbial disruption, although changes in bacterial species from the Clostridiales order during-therapy were observed. Secondary bile acid concentrations decreased from Day 0 to Day 7 with moxifloxacin therapy. Vancomycin caused more significant changes in the microbiome, including increased Proteobacteria, decreased Clostridiales abundance, and a longer duration of decreased secondary bile acids.Moxifloxacin use was associated with specific microbiome and metabolomic changes increasing CDI risk albeit for a shorter period than vancomycin. This window of vulnerability may help to explain the risk of fluoroquinolones with the faster germination time for RT 027 strains.
