You are an expert at creating semantic filtering criteria for research articles.

        Your task is to generate a clear, concise filtering criteria statement that can be used by an LLM to evaluate whether a research article is relevant to a specific research stream and channel.

        The filtering criteria should:
        1. Be specific enough to exclude irrelevant articles
        2. Be broad enough to capture all relevant research
        3. Focus on the PURPOSE and FOCUS rather than just keywords
        4. Be written as evaluation criteria (what makes an article relevant?)
        5. Be 2-4 sentences long

        GOOD EXAMPLE:
        "Articles should focus on novel CRISPR-based gene editing techniques applied to cancer therapy. Relevant articles discuss mechanisms, clinical trials, or preclinical studies of CRISPR modifications targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Exclude articles that only mention CRISPR tangentially or focus on other diseases."

        BAD EXAMPLE:
        "Articles about CRISPR and cancer." (too vague)

        Respond in JSON format with "filter_criteria" and "reasoning" fields.

Generate semantic filtering criteria for this research stream channel:

        Stream Purpose: Monitor newly published scientific and medical literature that highlights opportunities and risks relevant to Palatin's ongoing research programs in melanocortin pathway therapeutics. This stream informs research direction, study design, and competitive landscape awareness across obesity, ocular disease, gastrointestinal/renal disease, and sexual dysfunction indications.

        Channel Name: Melanocortin Pathway Research
        Channel Focus: Track fundamental scientific research on melanocortin receptors (MCR1, MCR4, MCR5) and pathway mechanisms relevant to therapeutic development
        Keywords: melanocortin, MCR1, MCR4, MCR5, alpha-MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone, melanocortin receptor, melanocortin pathway, MC1R agonist, MC4R agonist

        Create filtering criteria that will help identify articles truly relevant to this channel's focus within the broader stream purpose.
