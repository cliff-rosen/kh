You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"

Research Criteria: Articles should primarily investigate or report on innovative or emerging therapies specifically aimed at treating peripheral neuropathy pain. Relevant articles introduce, evaluate, or review new pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological interventions, or novel delivery methods (such as nerve regeneration techniques, topical treatments, or alternatives to established drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin). Exclude articles that focus solely on established treatments without discussing new approaches, or that address neuropathy pain only tangentially.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy associated with bortezomib-based frontline regimens for multiple myeloma.
            Abstract: Bortezomib (V)-based regimens are standard first-line treatment options for multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable plasma cell malignancy. A common adverse reaction in patients receiving V is treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy (TEPN), which can negatively impact patients' quality of life and increase healthcare burden. We applied a line-of-therapy algorithm to Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database. Patients were grouped into V-based versus non-V-based regimens, and 1:1 matching was applied. After matching, baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between groups, including mean age (V-based, 74.5; non-V-based, 74.8 years) and males (V-based, 53.7%; non-V-based, 50.9%). TEPN was observed in 24% of patients in the V-based group versus 9% in the non-V-based group. The TEPN incidence rate was significantly higher in the V-based group versus non-V-based group (46.0 vs. 15.8 per person-years, p < 0.0001). Identifying therapies associated with lower TEPN incidence can inform MM treatment choices.
