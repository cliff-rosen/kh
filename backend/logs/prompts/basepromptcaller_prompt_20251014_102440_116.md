You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical trials or clinical interventions that investigate the impact of gut microbiome modulation (such as probiotics, fecal transplants, or microbiome-targeted therapies) on mental health outcomes, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, or autism. Relevant articles must present original clinical data, trial protocols, or results directly linking microbiome interventions to changes in mental health status. Exclude articles that are purely preclinical, review articles without new clinical findings, or those that discuss microbiome and mental health associations without a clinical intervention or trial component.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Aberrant Growth in 5-Year-Old Children After Antibiotics in the First Week of Life.
            Abstract: We examined the relationship between early-life antibiotics, different regimens, and growth until age five years.Data from two parallel birth cohorts were analysed: 128 healthy term-born children and 147 term-born children who received antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis, randomised across three regimens: Amoxicillin+Cefotaxime, Augmentin+Gentamicin, Penicillin+Gentamicin. Until age five years, growth, environmental exposures, diet, and physical activity data were collected. Primary outcomes were weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores with early-life antibiotic exposure and the regimen as determinants of interest.The median antibiotic exposure duration was 3 days (interquartile range 2.4-5.5 days). Children exposed to early-life antibiotics had on average 0.26 lower weight-for-height z-scores over the first five years compared to unexposed controls (p = 0.014). Especially children treated with Augmentin+Gentamicin showed lower weight-for-height z-scores, compared to unexposed controls (coefficient = 0.36; p = 0.013). Additionally, at age five years, higher birth weight percentiles were associated with higher weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height and weekly lemonade consumption was associated with higher weight-for-age z-scores.Antibiotics in the first week of life are associated with lower weight-for-height up to age five years, with effects varying by treatment type. To explain these effects, further examination of antimicrobial-induced early-life microbiome perturbations and subsequent growth is needed.International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (https://trialsearch.who.int/): NL4882 and NL3821.
