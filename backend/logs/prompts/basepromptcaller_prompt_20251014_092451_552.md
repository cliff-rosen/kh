You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical research, including clinical trials or observational studies, that evaluate interventions targeting the gut-brain axis for the treatment or management of mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Relevant articles must focus on human subjects and assess the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of gut-brain interventions (e.g., microbiome modulation, psychobiotics, dietary interventions) in relation to mood disorder outcomes. Exclude articles that are preclinical, focus solely on mechanistic or animal studies, or discuss gut-brain interventions for non-mood-related conditions.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Interactions between gut microbiota and parkinson's disease: the role of tryptophan metabolism.
            Abstract: Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, is characterized by motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, highlighting its nature as a multisystem disease. The critical role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in maintaining human homeostasis is well established, and growing evidence links its dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis to Parkinson's disease. Communication between the microbiota and the brain occurs through various pathways, including the vagus nerve, intestinal hormonal signals, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, and microbial metabolites. Among these, tryptophan metabolism is a key metabolic pathway. As an essential amino acid that animal cells cannot synthesize, tryptophan and its metabolites in the intestine depend entirely on dietary intake and gut microbiota production. In the gastrointestinal tract, tryptophan metabolism occurs via three main pathways-the indole pathway, the kynurenine pathway, and the serotonin pathway-all directly or indirectly regulated by gut microbiota. These metabolites are vital in mediating the 'microbiota-gut-brain' dialogue and regulating gastrointestinal functions. Additionally, some metabolites mediate central nervous system inflammation and contribute to neurodegenerative disease processes as aromatic hydrocarbon receptor ligands. This review examines recent research on gut microbiota and host tryptophan co-metabolism and their roles in the development of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, it explores how targeting gut microbiota and modulating tryptophan metabolism could offer potential therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease.
