You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical trials or clinical interventions that investigate the impact of gut microbiome modulation (such as probiotics, fecal transplants, or microbiome-targeted therapies) on mental health outcomes, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, or autism. Relevant articles must present original clinical data, trial protocols, or results directly linking microbiome interventions to changes in mental health status. Exclude articles that are purely preclinical, review articles without new clinical findings, or those that discuss microbiome and mental health associations without a clinical intervention or trial component.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Food- vs. supplement-based very-low-energy diets and gut microbiome composition in women with high body mass index: A randomized controlled trial.
            Abstract: In a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled-feeding trial (May 2021-February 2022), 47 women (30-65 years, BMI 30-45 kg/m2) are randomized to either a food-based or a supplement-based very-low-energy diet (VLED: 800-900 kcal/d) for 3 weeks. The food-based VLED comprises pre-packaged meals (∼93% whole-food ingredients), while the supplement-based VLED comprises shakes, soups, bars, and desserts (∼70% industrial ingredients). The primary outcome is species-level alpha diversity (Shannon index). Secondary outcomes include species richness, beta diversity, taxonomic composition, functional potential, anthropometrics, serum biomarkers, mental health, sleep, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analyses (n = 45) assess diet group × time interactions as beta coefficients (β) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A between-group differential change is observed for the Shannon index, with a greater increase in the food-based group (mITT β: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60). The food-based group also shows greater species richness, smaller beta diversity shifts, and compositional changes preserving fiber-degrading, health-associated taxa.
