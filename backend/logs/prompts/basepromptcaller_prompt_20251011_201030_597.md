You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",

Research Criteria: Articles should primarily investigate or report on innovative or emerging therapies specifically aimed at treating peripheral neuropathy pain. Relevant articles introduce, evaluate, or review new pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological interventions, or novel delivery methods (such as nerve regeneration techniques, topical treatments, or alternatives to established drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin). Exclude articles that focus solely on established treatments without discussing new approaches, or that address neuropathy pain only tangentially.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Celecoxib pretreatment and nab-paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome in patients with breast cancer: a prospective, non-randomized controlled clinical study.
            Abstract: Taxane-associated acute pain syndrome (T-APS) is a frequent adverse effect in breast cancer patients undergoing nab-paclitaxel, affecting treatment adherence and quality of life (QoL). We analyzed the effectiveness of preventative celecoxib on T-APS among these patients.This non-randomized controlled trial included 270 breast cancer patients receiving nab-paclitaxel who experienced musculoskeletal pain during the first cycle. Subjects were assigned to receive celecoxib (200Â mg, administered on Days 1-7) or a placebo. The main outcome measured was the overall incidence of severe T-APS (> 5 on a 0-10 scale) during cycles 2-4. Secondary endpoints included the incidence, severity, and duration of T-APS (assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory scale); QoL; peripheral nerve function; and adverse events.The overall incidence of severe T-APS was 10.2% in the celecoxib group and 50.0% in the placebo group during cycles 2-4 (p < 0.001). Mean FACT-B subscale scores were significantly higher in the celecoxib group (101.62, 95% CI: 99.70-103.53; 105.59, 95% CI: 103.57-107.61; and 108.02, 95%CI: 106.18-109.85) than the placebo group (99.02, 95% CI: 97.29-100.76; 99.80, 95% CI: 98.03-101.57; and 99.10, 95% CI: 97.39-100.81) (p < 0.05). QoL on EORTC QLQ-C30 was also better in the celecoxib group, except for appetite loss, fatigue, and insomnia (p < 0.05). Following four cycles, the mean scores on the FACT-Ntx subscale in the celecoxib group remained higher (34.10, 95% CI: 33.29-34.91 vs 32.25, 95% CI: 31.63-32.88) (p < 0.01). Additionally, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy at grade 1 or higher in CTCAE 5.0 was reduced in the celecoxib group (36.7% vs 63.8%, p < 0.001).Preventative celecoxib significantly reduced the incidence of severe T-APS and improved QoL in breast cancer patients.
