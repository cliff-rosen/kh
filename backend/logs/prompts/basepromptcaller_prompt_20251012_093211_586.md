Generate an executive summary for this research stream:

        Stream Name: Palatin Scientific Literature Monitor
        Stream Purpose: Monitor newly published scientific and medical literature that highlights opportunities and risks relevant to Palatin's ongoing research programs in melanocortin pathway therapeutics. This stream informs research direction, study design, and competitive landscape awareness across obesity, ocular disease, gastrointestinal/renal disease, and sexual dysfunction indications.

        Channel Results:
        
**Melanocortin Pathway Research** (4 articles accepted)
  1. Characterization of prevalent genetic variants in the Estonian Biobank body-mass index GWAS.
     Population-specific genome-wide association studies can reveal high-impact genomic variants that influence traits like body-mass index (BMI). Using the Estonian Biobank BMI dataset (n = 204,747 participants) we identified 214 genome-wide significant loci. Among those hits, we identified a common non
  2. Rotenone-mediated mitochondrial ROS generation inhibits melanogenesis in B16F10 cells by inducing the ERK activation-MITF degradation pathway.
     Pachyrhizus erosus seeds have been reported to have various biological activities, including antifungal, antisecretory, insecticidal, antibacterial, and antispasmodic properties. In this study, we evaluated the hypopigmentation effects of the ethanol extract of Pachyrhizus erosus seeds (PESE), ident
  3. Molecular characterization of colistin resistance in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from a tertiary hospital in China.
     Colistin resistance in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) poses a significant global health challenge, as colistin remains the last-resort antibiotic for treating multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae infections. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and molecular mechanisms unde
  4. Tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus regulate peripheral leukocytes during inflammatory pain.
     People suffering from pain are more susceptible to infection due to the pain-induced alterations of immune function. The release of glucocorticoids (GCs) via the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been considered as a major explanation for regulating glucose and energy m
