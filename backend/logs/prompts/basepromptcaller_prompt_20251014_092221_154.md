You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

Research Criteria: Articles should present significant new findings on the biological mechanisms or biomarkers underlying the gut-brain axis as they relate to mood disorders. Relevant articles must focus on elucidating pathways, molecular interactions, or physiological processes (such as neurotransmitter modulation, immune signaling, or microbial metabolites) that directly link gut function to mood regulation or depressive symptoms. Exclude articles that only discuss general gut health, mood disorders without gut-brain context, or therapeutic interventions without mechanistic insight.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Assessment of intestinal barrier integrity and associations with innate immune activation and metabolic syndrome in acutely ill, antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients.
            Abstract: Schizophrenia (Sz), once seen solely as a brain disorder, is now recognised as a systemic illness involving immune and metabolic dysregulation. The intestinal barrier has emerged as a key player in gut-brain-immune interactions. However, studies in early, antipsychotic free stages remain scarce and often neglect confounding factors such as smoking and metabolic syndrome.We measured two complementary markers: lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), reflecting endotoxin exposure and systemic immune activation, and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), indicating gut epithelial damage and permeability changes, in blood from 96 acutely ill, antipsychotic-free Sz patients (61 first-episode, 35 relapsed) and 96 matched controls. Associations with innate immunity, metabolic parameters, smoking, and clinical features were assessed using nonparametric statistics and random forest regression. Group differences were tested using covariate adjustment, as well as in a separate analysis of non-smokers (Sz: n = 42; controls: n = 84).Median LBP was higher in Sz (21.96 µg/mL) vs. controls (18.10 µg/mL; FDR-adjusted p = 0.021, δ = 0.209) but became non-significant after adjusting for smoking (FDR-adjusted p = 0.199). In contrast, I-FABP was lower in Sz (218.2 pg/mL) than controls (315.0 pg/mL; FDR-adjusted p = 0.021, δ = -0.195) and remained robust across smoking-adjusted analyses. No differences were found between first-episode and relapsed patients for either marker. LBP correlated strongly with CRP (r = 0.557, p < 0.001) and neutrophils (r = 0.468, p < 0.001) and was moderately predicted by immune models (pseudo-R2 = 0.354 overall; 0.273 Sz; 0.449 controls). Links to waist circumference and blood pressure were weaker (pseudo-R2: 0.048-0.104). I-FABP showed fewer immune associations and was not correlated with LBP (r = -0.017, FDR-adjusted p = 0.819), suggesting distinct mechanisms.Our findings suggest separable gut‑related processes in antipsychotic-free Sz. The apparent LBP elevation was not schizophrenia‑specific; its strong correlations with CRP and neutrophils point to smoking related inflammation rather than a schizophrenia specific effect. Accordingly, prior findings of LBP elevations in Sz likely reflect unaccounted smoking. In contrast, reduced I-FABP, independent of smoking, may indicate epithelial injury. The absent correlation between LBP and I-FABP highlights distinct pathophysiological dimensions of gut dysfunction. Longitudinal studies, ideally spanning prodromal phases and integrating microbiome, dietary, smoking, and permeability assessments, are needed to clarify temporal dynamics and guide stratified treatments.
