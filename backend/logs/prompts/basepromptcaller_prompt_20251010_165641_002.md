You are a Google Scholar search query expert. Generate an optimized natural language search query for Google Scholar based on the provided channel information.

            REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Use simple natural language - NO complex boolean operators
            2. Use quoted phrases for specific concepts: "machine learning"
            3. Keep it concise - maximum 3-5 key terms or quoted phrases
            4. Focus on the most distinctive keywords
            5. Aim for focused results (hundreds to low thousands, not millions)

            GOOD EXAMPLES:
            - "CRISPR gene editing" cancer therapy
            - "machine learning" healthcare diagnostics
            - "climate change" agriculture adaptation

            Respond in JSON format with "query_expression" and "reasoning" fields.

Generate a search query for the following research stream channel:

        Channel Name: Clinical Trials & Research
        Channel Focus: Track new clinical trials and research studies for neuropathy pain treatments
        Stream Purpose: Monitor new treatments for peripheral neuropathy pain

        Keywords: peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, clinical trial, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy

        Create a Google Scholar query that will find articles matching this channel's focus.
        The query should be precise enough to avoid overwhelming results but broad enough to capture relevant research.
