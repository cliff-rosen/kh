You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

Research Criteria: Articles should present original scientific research that investigates the biological mechanisms linking the gut microbiome to mental health or brain function. Relevant studies must focus on elucidating pathways, interactions, or causal relationships—such as microbial metabolites, neural signaling (e.g., vagus nerve), or modulation of neurotransmitters—underlying the gut-brain axis. Exclude articles that only discuss associations without mechanistic insight, reviews without new data, or studies unrelated to mental health outcomes.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Preoperative plasma short- and branched-chain fatty acids in relation to risk of complications after colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study.
            Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that nutritional prehabilitation reduces risk of complications after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. The gut microbiota and its metabolic activity potentially link preoperative diet to postoperative outcomes.Investigate associations between preoperative plasma levels of microbial-derived metabolites and postoperative complications in CRC patients.We used data from a prospective cohort study among 1220 patients with non-metastatic CRC. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate, as well as the branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) isovalerate, isobutyrate and α-methylbutyrate were measured in plasma collected at diagnosis. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated using regression models adjusted for age, sex, tumor location, smoking status, and physical health status.Acetate levels of 40.0 μmol/L were associated with a lower risk of any postoperative complications compared to the reference of 20.0 μmol/L (PR 0.76; 95%CI 0.62, 0.93). Higher levels of propionate (per 1 μmol/L) were associated with a lower risk of any complications (PR 0.84; 95%CI 0.73, 0.96). Similar associations were found for acetate (per 20 μmol/L) and propionate (per 1 μmol/L) in relation to surgical complications (PR 0.75; 95%CI 0.60, 0.93; and PR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69, 1.00; respectively). No associations were found for BCFAs in relation to complications. Low (below median) total SCFA levels combined with high (above median) total BCFA levels were least favorable in terms of complication risk (PR 1.35; 95%CI 1.02, 1.80) when compared to a low SCFA/low BCFA profile.Our findings suggest that microbial fermentation processes, mainly those resulting in higher SCFA levels, may be linked to postoperative recovery. These findings provide leads for future studies investigating the role of preoperative diet, especially the balance between fiber and protein intake, and microbial metabolism in relation to postoperative recovery of patients with CRC.This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT03191110.
