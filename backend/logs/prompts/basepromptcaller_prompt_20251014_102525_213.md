  1. Detoxification of domoic acid from Pseudo-nitzschia by gut microbiota in Acartia erythraea.
     Domoic acid (DA) is a neurotoxin produced by certain species of Pseudo-nitzschia (PSN) that can cause damage to neural tissues and can be fatal to marine animals. Copepods, direct consumers of PSN, exhibit remarkable resistance to DA. Given that gut microbiota facilitate various detoxification proce
  2. Host-microbiota interactions regulate gut serotonergic signaling and implications for hypertension.
     Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a highly conserved signaling molecule present across diverse taxa, including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. In mammals, the majority of peripheral serotonin is synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract by enteric neurons and enterochromaffin cells via tryp
  3. Maternal dietary fibre intake results in sex-specific single-cell molecular changes in the heart of the offspring.
     Some types of dietary fibre undergo fermentation by the gut microbiome, producing microbial metabolites called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) - these are protective against cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emerging evidence suggests that maternal fibre intake also protects the offspring. Here, we aime
  4. Evaluating short-chain fatty acids in breath condensate as surrogate measurements for systemic levels and investigation into alternative respiratory sample matrices.
     Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolic by-products from microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates and protein. They have gained clinical interest for their protective effects, including within the lung microenvironment. SCFAs are detectable in circulation and exhaled breath condensate (
  5. Tolerogenic probiotics and gut-brain axis: targeting pain receptors in neuroimmune disorders.
     Tolerogenic probiotics, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, offer significant therapeutic potential for neuroimmune disorders by modulating the gut-brain axis to promote immune tolerance and reduce inflammation. These probiotics influence key cell types, such as enteroendocrine cell
  6. The latest views on how vagus nerve stimulation works in epilepsy: a plain language summary.

  7. Microbiome and Metabolome Alterations in Nrf2 Knockout Mice With Induced Gut Inflammation and Fed With Phenethyl Isothiocyanate and Cranberry Enriched Diets.
     Cranberries contain phytochemicals with potent antioxidant properties. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is abundant in crucifers and possesses anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. These food additives can alter gut microbiota and improve the host's health. Microbiome and microbial metabolom
  8. Microbiome Signatures and Their Role in Uveitis: Pathogenesis, Diagnostics, and Therapeutic Perspectives.
     Non-infectious uveitis is a group of complex inflammatory eye diseases shaped by genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, and environmental cues. Among these, the mucosal microbiome-including gut, oral, and ocular surface microbial communities-has emerged as a key player in modulating systemic 
  9. Orally administered degradable nanoarmor-assisted probiotics for remodeling the gut microenvironment and treating osteoporosis.
     Improving the intestinal microenvironment and regulating the intestinal flora are highly important in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although previous studies have shown that oral probiotics can prevent or reverse bone loss, their survival rate and therapeutic effect are greatly reduced when they pa
  10. Preoperative plasma short- and branched-chain fatty acids in relation to risk of complications after colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study.
     Emerging evidence suggests that nutritional prehabilitation reduces risk of complications after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. The gut microbiota and its metabolic activity potentially link preoperative diet to postoperative outcomes.Investigate associations between preoperative plasma levels of m

**Clinical Developments** (9 articles accepted)
  1. A randomized phase 1 study investigating gut microbiome changes with moxifloxacin vs. oral vancomycin: Implications for Clostridioides difficile risk.
     The epidemic, hypervirulent Clostridioides difficile ribotype (RT) 027 strain is associated with bacterial virulence traits, including faster germination time and resistance to moxifloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone. Although linked to the RT 027 epidemic, studies to understand moxifloxac
  2. Food- vs. supplement-based very-low-energy diets and gut microbiome composition in women with high body mass index: A randomized controlled trial.
     In a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled-feeding trial (May 2021-February 2022), 47 women (30-65 years, BMI 30-45 kg/m2) are randomized to either a food-based or a supplement-based very-low-energy diet (VLED: 800-900 kcal/d) for 3 weeks. The food-based VLED comprises pre-packaged meals (âˆ¼93
  3. Operational determinants of recruitment and biospecimen collection in translational observational studies: a multi-site comparative analysis.
     Biospecimen collection from study participants is essential for translational research, but operational challenges in study setup and conduct often impede successful delivery. This study uses a comparative approach to explore key logistical and staffing factors influencing setup duration, recruitmen
  4. 12-week preoperative probiotic supplementation versus placebo: effects on inflammation, endotoxemia, adipokines, and gastrointestinal peptides in patients six months after bariatric surgery - a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
     Disruption in gut microbiota has been identified as a contributor to obesity-related inflammation and metabolic disorders. This study investigates the effects of preoperative probiotic supplementation on inflammation, endotoxemia, adipokines, and gastrointestinal peptides after bariatric surgery.Thi
  5. Probiotics improve functional performance in patients with osteoarthritis: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.
     Osteoarthritis (OA), a progressive joint degeneration, significantly impairs people's ability to perform everyday tasks. Currently, there are no treatment options to cure OA.To explore the potential of probiotics to improve functional performance in OA patients.This study follows a single-center, do
  6. Aberrant Growth in 5-Year-Old Children After Antibiotics in the First Week of Life.
     We examined the relationship between early-life antibiotics, different regimens, and growth until age five years.Data from two parallel birth cohorts were analysed: 128 healthy term-born children and 147 term-born children who received antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis, randomised across thr
  7. Effects of dietary energy restriction of ultra-processed foods compared to a generic energy restriction on the intestinal microbiota of individuals with obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.
     Evidence suggests that the intake of ultra-processed foods (UPF) influences gut microbiota. The present study evaluated the impact of energy restriction of dietary UPF compared to a general energy restriction on the gut microbiota of individuals with obesity. This was a parallel, randomized clinical
  8. Gut-microbiota-derived indole sulfate promotes heart failure in chronic kidney disease.
     Heart failure (HF) is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associates with alterations in gut microbiota, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, complicating diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we identify indoxyl sulfate (IS), produced by E. coli through the tryptoph
  9. Rifaximin reduces gut-derived inflammation in severe acute pancreatitis: an experimental animal model and randomized controlled trial.
     Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is characterized by systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction and is often associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. Rifaximin, a gut-specific non-absorbable antibiotic, is known to modulate the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated rifaximin's effects
