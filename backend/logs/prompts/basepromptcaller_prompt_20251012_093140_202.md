You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",

Research Criteria: Articles should primarily investigate the biology, signaling mechanisms, or pharmacological modulation of melanocortin receptors (specifically MCR1, MCR4, or MCR5) or the broader melanocortin pathway, with clear relevance to therapeutic development. Relevant studies may include molecular, cellular, or animal research elucidating receptor function, ligand interactions, or pathway regulation, as well as research identifying novel targets or mechanisms within the melanocortin system. Exclude articles that only mention melanocortin components peripherally or focus on unrelated pathways or indications.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Characterization of prevalent genetic variants in the Estonian Biobank body-mass index GWAS.
            Abstract: Population-specific genome-wide association studies can reveal high-impact genomic variants that influence traits like body-mass index (BMI). Using the Estonian Biobank BMI dataset (n = 204,747 participants) we identified 214 genome-wide significant loci. Among those hits, we identified a common non-coding variant within the newly associated ADGRL3 gene (-0.18 kg/m²; P = 3.21 × 10⁻⁹). Moreover, the missense rare variant PTPRT:p.Arg1384His associated with lower BMI (-0.44 kg/m²; P = 2.51 × 10⁻¹⁰), while the protein-truncating variant POMC:p.Glu206* was associated with considerably higher BMI (+ 0.81 kg/m²; P = 1.48 × 10-12), both likely affecting the functioning of the leptin-melanocortin pathway. POMC:p.Glu206* was observed in different North-European populations, suggesting a broader, yet elusive, distribution of this damaging variant. These observations indicate the previously unrecognized roles of the ADGRL3 and PTPRT genes in body weight regulation and suggest an increased prevalence of the POMC:p.Glu206* variant in European populations, offering avenues for developing interventions in obesity management.
