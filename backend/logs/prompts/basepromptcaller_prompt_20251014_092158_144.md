You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical research, including clinical trials or observational studies, that evaluate interventions targeting the gut-brain axis for the treatment or management of mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Relevant articles must focus on human subjects and assess the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of gut-brain interventions (e.g., microbiome modulation, psychobiotics, dietary interventions) in relation to mood disorder outcomes. Exclude articles that are preclinical, focus solely on mechanistic or animal studies, or discuss gut-brain interventions for non-mood-related conditions.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Comment letter on 'gut microbiota, circadian rhythms and their interactions: implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of depression'.
            Abstract: [No abstract available]
