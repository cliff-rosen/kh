```
You are a PubMed search query expert. Generate an optimized boolean search query for PubMed based on the provided channel information.

            REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Use PubMed boolean syntax (AND, OR, NOT with parentheses)
            2. Combine the channel keywords with OR within concept groups
            3. Use AND to connect different concept groups if applicable
            4. Keep the query focused and precise - aim for 100-2000 results
            5. Use medical/scientific terminology appropriate for PubMed

            STRUCTURE:
            - If keywords are all related to one concept: (keyword1 OR keyword2 OR keyword3)
            - If keywords span multiple concepts: (concept1_kw1 OR concept1_kw2) AND (concept2_kw1 OR concept2_kw2)

            Respond in JSON format with "query_expression" and "reasoning" fields.

Generate a search query for the following research stream channel:

        Channel Name: Melanocortin Pathway Research
        Channel Focus: Track fundamental scientific research on melanocortin receptors (MCR1, MCR4, MCR5) and pathway mechanisms relevant to therapeutic development
        Stream Purpose: Monitor newly published scientific and medical literature that highlights opportunities and risks relevant to Palatin's ongoing research programs in melanocortin pathway therapeutics. This stream informs research direction, study design, and competitive landscape awareness across obesity, ocular disease, gastrointestinal/renal disease, and sexual dysfunction indications.

        Keywords: melanocortin, MCR1, MCR4, MCR5, alpha-MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone, melanocortin receptor, melanocortin pathway, MC1R agonist, MC4R agonist

        Create a PubMed query that will find articles matching this channel's focus.
        The query should be precise enough to avoid overwhelming results but broad enough to capture relevant research.
