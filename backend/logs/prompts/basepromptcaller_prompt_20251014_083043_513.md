You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should present significant new findings on the biological mechanisms or biomarkers underlying the gut-brain axis as they relate to mood disorders. Relevant articles must focus on elucidating pathways, molecular interactions, or physiological processes (such as neurotransmitter modulation, immune signaling, or microbial metabolites) that directly link gut function to mood regulation or depressive symptoms. Exclude articles that only discuss general gut health, mood disorders without gut-brain context, or therapeutic interventions without mechanistic insight.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Salivary Biomarker Panel That Identifies Periodontitis in Persons With Type 2 Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Study.
            Abstract: This secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that a salivary biomarker panel (i.e., consisting of 2-6 features) could accurately identify periodontitis in persons with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared with non-periodontitis in systemically healthy persons.Salivary concentrations of 12 protein biomarkers and 14 oral microbiome species were evaluated by immunoassays and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively, from 28 systemically healthy non-periodontitis adults and 28 T2DM patients with periodontitis. Data were analysed for the identification of periodontitis from non-periodontitis using 5-fold cross-validation logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and odds ratios.Bacteria showed better predictive value than individual salivary proteins. Two bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Mycoplasma faucium) yielded specificities > 90%, Prevotella species yielded high sensitivity (86%) and Treponema socranskii demonstrated the top area under the curve (AUC) (0.81). A salivary panel consisting of bacteria (Selenomonas sputigena, P. gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Pr. dentalis) and protein ratios (prostaglandin E2/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1α/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) produced robust diagnostic accuracy (95%) and precision (96.6%) for the detection of periodontitis in T2DM.A salivary panel using bacteria and ratios of host-response biomarkers accurately identified periodontitis in T2DM compared with systemically healthy persons without periodontitis.
