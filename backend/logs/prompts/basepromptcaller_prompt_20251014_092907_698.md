**Clinical Research** (9 articles accepted)
  1. Food- vs. supplement-based very-low-energy diets and gut microbiome composition in women with high body mass index: A randomized controlled trial.
     In a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled-feeding trial (May 2021-February 2022), 47 women (30-65 years, BMI 30-45 kg/m2) are randomized to either a food-based or a supplement-based very-low-energy diet (VLED: 800-900 kcal/d) for 3 weeks. The food-based VLED comprises pre-packaged meals (∼93
  2. A Walnut-Derived Peptide WSPSGR Alleviates Depressive-Like Behaviors in Mice via IDO1 Inhibition and Gut Microbiota-Tryptophan Axis Modulation.
     Depression is a complex psychiatric disorder with increasing global impact. This study explored the antidepressant mechanisms of Trp-Ser-Pro-Ser-Gly-Arg (WSPSGR), a walnut-derived peptide with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitory activity. In a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-ind
  3. Resveratrol alleviates IBD-associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities via microbiota-dependent arginine metabolism reprogramming and microglial M2 polarization through gut-brain axis.
     Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is intricately linked to neuropsychiatric comorbidities through gut-brain axis dysregulation. This study demonstrates that resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, alleviates DSS-induced colitis-associated anxiety and depression by reprogramming the microbiota─metabo
  4. Functional dyspepsia: from human to dog, a retrospective study of 29 cases illustrating a complex entity.
     Functional gastrointestinal disorders, including mostly functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome, are highly prevalent in human patients. FD is a complex condition in human gastroenterology and is characterized by abdominal discomfort, epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness,
  5. Ginsenoside Rh1 inhibits tumor growth in mice with colorectal cancer and depressive symptoms via modulation of the gut microbiota and tumor microenvironment.
     Depression can accelerate the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), and depressive remission improves cancer outcomes. Ginsenoside Rh1, the main metabolite of a steroidal saponin extracted from Panax ginseng, improves memory and learning and to inhibit tumor growth. However, its anticancer effects
  6. Interactions between gut microbiota and parkinson's disease: the role of tryptophan metabolism.
     Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, is characterized by motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal dysfunction, highlighting its nature as a multisystem disease. The critical role of the microbiota-
  7. Comment letter on 'gut microbiota, circadian rhythms and their interactions: implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of depression'.
     [No abstract available]
  8. The role of caffeine and probiotics in modulating biochemical alterations induced by constant light-mediated circadian rhythm disruption in a rat model.
     Light pollution has become a potential health risk factor worldwide. It exerts its effect by disrupting the circadian rhythms, which is linked to adverse health outcomes, including mood disturbances. Caffeine can influence alertness and sleep patterns, while probiotics may affect circadian regulatio
  9. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic perturbations of bile/glyceric acids in major depressive disorder with IBS comorbidity.
     Major depressive disorder (MDD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exhibit high comorbidity, yet their shared pathophysiology remains unclear. Previous studies have primarily focused on the psychological health in the IBS population, without considering psychiatric diagnoses or stratifying different

**Scientific Discoveries** (10 articles accepted)
  1. Salivary Biomarker Panel That Identifies Periodontitis in Persons With Type 2 Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis of a Cross-Sectional Study.
     This secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that a salivary biomarker panel (i.e., consisting of 2-6 features) could accurately identify periodontitis in persons with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared with non-periodontitis in systemically healthy persons.Salivary concentr
  2. Assessment of intestinal barrier integrity and associations with innate immune activation and metabolic syndrome in acutely ill, antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients.
     Schizophrenia (Sz), once seen solely as a brain disorder, is now recognised as a systemic illness involving immune and metabolic dysregulation. The intestinal barrier has emerged as a key player in gut-brain-immune interactions. However, studies in early, antipsychotic free stages remain scarce and 
  3. Multiomics strategy-based obesity biomarkers discovery for precision medicine.
     Obesity is a multifaceted metabolic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, often comorbid with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Due to its diverse etiological factors and inherent heterogeneity, obesity pos
  4. Evaluating short-chain fatty acids in breath condensate as surrogate measurements for systemic levels and investigation into alternative respiratory sample matrices.
     Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolic by-products from microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates and protein. They have gained clinical interest for their protective effects, including within the lung microenvironment. SCFAs are detectable in circulation and exhaled breath condensate (
  5. Tolerogenic probiotics and gut-brain axis: targeting pain receptors in neuroimmune disorders.
     Tolerogenic probiotics, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, offer significant therapeutic potential for neuroimmune disorders by modulating the gut-brain axis to promote immune tolerance and reduce inflammation. These probiotics influence key cell types, such as enteroendocrine cell
  6. The Role of the Microbiome in Endometriosis.
     Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, leading to pain and infertility. Recent research has highlighted the important role of the microbiome in various health conditions, including endometriosis. The aim of this r
  7. Development of an Aptamer/CRISPR-Cas12a-Based Dual-Modal Biosensor for Fusobacterium nucleatum Detection in Non-Invasive Colorectal Cancer Screening.
     Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, current CRC screening methods are complex, invasive, and tend to exhibit low sensitivity. Recent evidence has highlighted gut microbiota dysbiosis, especially elevated Fusobacterium
  8. The exposomal imprint on rosacea: More than skin deep.
     Rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory dermatosis driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, collectively known as the exposome. This review explores how intrinsic contributors such as genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, microbiome alterations, hormonal infl
  9. Bacterial guilds, not genus-level taxa, mediate the protective effects of time-restricted feeding against high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice.
     The gut microbiota functions as a complex adaptive system where microbes form structural modules known as "guilds." Each guild comprises taxonomically distinct microbes that work together as cohesive functional units, contributing to overall system function. Traditional taxon-based microbiome analys
  10. A Conceptual Review of Gut, Skin, and Oral Microbiota in Autoimmune Bullous Diseases: From Dysbiosis to Therapeutic Potential.
     Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs), including pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, are chronic inflammatory skin disorders characterized by dysregulated immune responses mediated by autoantibodies that target adhesion molecules in the skin and mucous membranes. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal
