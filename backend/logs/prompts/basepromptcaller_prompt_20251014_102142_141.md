You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {

Research Criteria: Articles should present original scientific research that investigates the biological mechanisms linking the gut microbiome to mental health or brain function. Relevant studies must focus on elucidating pathways, interactions, or causal relationships—such as microbial metabolites, neural signaling (e.g., vagus nerve), or modulation of neurotransmitters—underlying the gut-brain axis. Exclude articles that only discuss associations without mechanistic insight, reviews without new data, or studies unrelated to mental health outcomes.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: The microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease
            Abstract: … Can IBS subtypes be delineated on the basis of the microbiota? If patients with IBS have comorbid psychiatric illness, does the latter resolve if the former is treated with probiotics? …
