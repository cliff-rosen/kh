Research Criteria: Articles should primarily investigate or report on innovative or emerging therapies specifically aimed at treating peripheral neuropathy pain. Relevant articles introduce, evaluate, or review new pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological interventions, or novel delivery methods (such as nerve regeneration techniques, topical treatments, or alternatives to established drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin). Exclude articles that focus solely on established treatments without discussing new approaches, or that address neuropathy pain only tangentially.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Comment on "Factors influencing the decision to discontinue treatment due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy among patients with metastatic breast cancer: a best-worst scaling".
            Abstract: [No abstract available]
