Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical trials or original research studies that investigate new or emerging treatments specifically aimed at alleviating peripheral neuropathy pain in human subjects. Relevant articles must focus on the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of interventions (pharmacological, non-pharmacological, or device-based) for neuropathic pain, including but not limited to diabetic or chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Exclude articles that only discuss basic science, animal models, or general pain management without a clear focus on peripheral neuropathy pain treatments in clinical or research settings.
