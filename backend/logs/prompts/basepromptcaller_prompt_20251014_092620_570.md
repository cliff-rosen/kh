You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical research, including clinical trials or observational studies, that evaluate interventions targeting the gut-brain axis for the treatment or management of mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Relevant articles must focus on human subjects and assess the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of gut-brain interventions (e.g., microbiome modulation, psychobiotics, dietary interventions) in relation to mood disorder outcomes. Exclude articles that are preclinical, focus solely on mechanistic or animal studies, or discuss gut-brain interventions for non-mood-related conditions.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: A Walnut-Derived Peptide WSPSGR Alleviates Depressive-Like Behaviors in Mice via IDO1 Inhibition and Gut Microbiota-Tryptophan Axis Modulation.
            Abstract: Depression is a complex psychiatric disorder with increasing global impact. This study explored the antidepressant mechanisms of Trp-Ser-Pro-Ser-Gly-Arg (WSPSGR), a walnut-derived peptide with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitory activity. In a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse model, WSPSGR ameliorated depressive-like behaviors by restoring tryptophan (Trp) metabolic balance and reshaping gut microbiota composition. Notably, it reduced IDO1-mediated kynurenine (Kyn) pathway activation and corrected gut dysbiosis, including a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio. These effects collectively re-established microbiota-gut-brain axis homeostasis. These findings identify IDO1 as a key target of WSPSGR and suggest that peptide-based modulation of Trp metabolism and gut microbiota may be a promising strategy for depression therapy.
