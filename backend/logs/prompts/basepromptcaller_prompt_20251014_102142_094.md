You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,

Research Criteria: Articles should present original scientific research that investigates the biological mechanisms linking the gut microbiome to mental health or brain function. Relevant studies must focus on elucidating pathways, interactions, or causal relationships—such as microbial metabolites, neural signaling (e.g., vagus nerve), or modulation of neurotransmitters—underlying the gut-brain axis. Exclude articles that only discuss associations without mechanistic insight, reviews without new data, or studies unrelated to mental health outcomes.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Microbiome—the missing link in the gut-brain axis: focus on its role in gastrointestinal and mental health
            Abstract: … and immune function, (iv) altered gut microbiota, and (v) altered central nervous system (… the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The overlap of FGIDs and CNS disorders has been …
