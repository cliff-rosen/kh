You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical research, including clinical trials or observational studies, that evaluate interventions targeting the gut-brain axis for the treatment or management of mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Relevant articles must focus on human subjects and assess the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of gut-brain interventions (e.g., microbiome modulation, psychobiotics, dietary interventions) in relation to mood disorder outcomes. Exclude articles that are preclinical, focus solely on mechanistic or animal studies, or discuss gut-brain interventions for non-mood-related conditions.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: Resveratrol alleviates IBD-associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities via microbiota-dependent arginine metabolism reprogramming and microglial M2 polarization through gut-brain axis.
            Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is intricately linked to neuropsychiatric comorbidities through gut-brain axis dysregulation. This study demonstrates that resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol, alleviates DSS-induced colitis-associated anxiety and depression by reprogramming the microbiota─metabolite-barrier network. RSV (100 mg/kg/day) ameliorated DSS-associated anxiety-like behaviors in open field tests (peripheral zone time ↓12.6%, P< 0.0001) and depression-like phenotypes (TST immobility ↓31.0%, P = 0.0004). It restored colonic barrier integrity via ZO-1 mRNA upregulation (↑80.4%, P < 0.0001) and PAS score recovery (↑29.6%, P < 0.0001), while reducing systemic inflammation (serum LPS ↓31.9%, TNF-α ↓29.9%; P < 0.0001) vs. DSS. Crucially, RSV attenuated neuroinflammation by enhancing brain ZO-1 protein expression (↑146.1%, P = 0.0016), suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling (TLR4 mRNA ↓68.8%, MyD88 protein ↓48.8%; P < 0.05), and promoting M2 microglial polarization (CD206 protein ↑171.9%, P = 0.0003) vs. DSS. Multi-omics integration revealed RSV’s dual regulatory mechanism: ① Suppression of the pro-inflammatory Turicibacter4-guanidinobutanoic acid axis (↓42% and ↓37%, respectively; P < 0.01), disrupting LPS─TLR4─MyD88 cascades; ② Enrichment of barrier-protective Muribaculum (↑419%) and Dubosiella (↑208%), driving polyamine synthesis (spermidine ↑92%, spermine ↑38%) vs. DSS to reinforce gut-brain barriers. Spearman correlations confirmed Turicibacter-4-guanidinobutanoic acid-LPS-MyD88 interactions(r = 0.658-0.865) and Dubosiella-spermine-ZO-1 associations (r = 0.539-0.725). Conclusions: These findings establish RSV as a microbiota-metabolite modulator that redirects arginine metabolism from a pro-inflammatory bypass to polyamine-mediated barrier repair, offering novel therapeutic strategies for IBD-related neuropsychiatric complications. The integrated "microbe-metabolite-neuroimmune" axis provides mechanistic insights into gut-brain crosstalk, emphasizing dual-barrier restoration as a critical intervention node.Resveratrol (RSV) alleviates psychiatric comorbidities in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice by inhibiting the "Turicibacter-4-Guanidinobutanoic Acid-MyD88" axis and activating the "Muribaculum/Dubosiella-polyamine-ZO-1" repair axis. This results in the restoration of gut-brain barrier integrity, reduction of inflammation, and regulation of microglial M2 polarization.
