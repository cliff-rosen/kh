You are a research article evaluator. Your task is to determine whether research articles are relevant to specific research criteria.

            Evaluate each article based on its title and abstract, and determine if it addresses or is relevant to the given research criteria.

            Respond in JSON format:
            {
            "decision": "Yes" or "No",
            "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
            }

Research Criteria: Articles should report on clinical research, including clinical trials or observational studies, that evaluate interventions targeting the gut-brain axis for the treatment or management of mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Relevant articles must focus on human subjects and assess the efficacy, safety, or mechanisms of gut-brain interventions (e.g., microbiome modulation, psychobiotics, dietary interventions) in relation to mood disorder outcomes. Exclude articles that are preclinical, focus solely on mechanistic or animal studies, or discuss gut-brain interventions for non-mood-related conditions.

            Article to evaluate:
            Title: The role of caffeine and probiotics in modulating biochemical alterations induced by constant light-mediated circadian rhythm disruption in a rat model.
            Abstract: Light pollution has become a potential health risk factor worldwide. It exerts its effect by disrupting the circadian rhythms, which is linked to adverse health outcomes, including mood disturbances. Caffeine can influence alertness and sleep patterns, while probiotics may affect circadian regulation through the gut-brain axis. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the potential role of caffeine (30â€‰mg/kg) and probiotics (1 billion colony forming units (CFUs) per day) in alleviating biochemical alterations associated with depression following constant light exposure. Neurotransmitters, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and melatonin (MEL) were estimated in the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus. Hormonal levels of MEL and corticosterone (CORT) were measured in serum samples. LL exposure reduced serotonin (5-HT) levels. It also induced alteration in MEL and CORT rhythmicity. However, caffeine enhanced 5-HT and MEL content and modulated the temporal profile of MEL. Probiotics restored corticosterone and melatonin level to a temporal pattern like controls. Additionally, both treatments reduced MDA levels and enhanced GSH content. Coadministration of caffeine and probiotics reduced 5-HT levels. In conclusion, caffeine and probiotics could modulate biochemical alterations caused by constant light exposure, which is known to disrupt circadian rhythm in rodents, making them apropriate antidepressants.
