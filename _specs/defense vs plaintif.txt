SPECIAL RULES FOR STREAM 3 (GENETICS)
CRITICAL DISTINCTION REQUIRED:

Classify as [PRO-DEFENSE: PREDISPOSITION] if:
Demonstrates mesothelioma/ovarian cancer can occur due to genetics with minimal/no asbestos/talc exposure
Documents germline mutations causing disease independently
Shows familial clustering without occupational exposure
Quantifies penetrance of genetic mutations
Provides alternative causation pathway
Key test: Does this show genetics can cause disease WITHOUT exposure?

Classify as [PRO-PLAINTIFF: SUSCEPTIBILITY] if:
Demonstrates genetic variants ENHANCE risk FROM asbestos/talc exposure
Shows gene-environment interaction requiring BOTH
Documents differential susceptibility based on genotype
Quantifies modified dose-response in genetically susceptible individuals
Key test: Does this show genetics increase risk ONLY when exposed?

Classify as [NEUTRAL] if:
Molecular characterization without causation implications
Treatment/prognosis focus
Methodological advances
Requires further analysis to determine strategic position

Classify as [MIXED] if:
Shows both predisposition and susceptibility mechanisms
Data could support either interpretation
Insufficient exposure documentation to distinguish

EXPOSURE DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION:

For genetic predisposition claims, verify:
Was exposure history systematically assessed?
Were "minimal exposure" claims documented with industrial hygiene data?
Or is "no exposure" assumed without verification?

For genetic susceptibility claims, verify:
Was exposure quantified?
Was gene-environment interaction statistically tested?
Or is interaction merely implied?
