This scientific literature weekly alert has been tailored for Palatin Technologies, a company that is focused on developing novel therapies targeting the melanocortin and natriuretic pathways. The primary purpose of the newsletter is to alert company personnel to new scientific and medical literature that highlights risks and opportunities relevant to their business. The literature searches are focused on topics such as the safety and efficacy of bremelanotide (Palatinâ€™s FDA approved drug for female sexual dysfunction), other molecules that target the melanocortin pathway, as well as molecules that target the natriuretic pathway, especially those that work through the natriuretic peptide C pathway. Palatin is highly interested in the role of the melanocortin and natriuretic pathways as they may related to fibrosis, inflammation, ulcerative colitis, obesity, binge eating, and sexual dysfunction. Overall, this newsletter plays an important role in keeping the Palatin team up-to-date on the latest scientific and medical research, enabling them to make informed decisions and stay ahead in their pursuit to develop novel therapies.
