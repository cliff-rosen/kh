# PubMed Research Workflow Roadmap

## Target: Best Practice Research Workflow
Our goal is to support the proven academic research methodology:

1. **Create PubMed query** - Generate optimized search terms
2. **Execute query** - Run search and retrieve results  
3. **Manually browse top 20 or so results** - Human review to decide which abstracts to read
4. **Read those abstracts** - Detailed abstract analysis
5. **Decide which full articles to retrieve** - Human curation of promising articles
6. **Retrieve those articles** - Full-text acquisition
7. **Read each article and extract relevant info** - Deep analysis and information extraction
8. **Evaluate all extracted info for completeness and contradiction** - Quality assessment
9. **If eval fails, goto step 1** - Iterative refinement
10. **Generate final report from all extracted info** - Research synthesis

This iterative, human-guided approach ensures comprehensive coverage, quality control, and researchers maintain agency over their findings.

## Current State vs Target
- **Current Model**: Automated pipeline (query → search → extract → score → filter)
- **Target Model**: Human-in-the-loop research assistant
- **Key Gap**: Our tools automate what should be human decisions and miss critical manual review steps

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Interactive Review Foundation (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Add human decision points to existing pipeline

1. **pubmed_review_abstracts** tool
   - Present abstracts in reviewable format
   - Support selection/rejection decisions
   - Add review notes capability
   - Track review status in assets

2. **Asset Model Extensions**
   - Add review_status field (reviewed/unreviewed)
   - Add selection_status field (selected/rejected/pending)
   - Add review_notes field
   - Add reviewer_id for multi-user support

3. **UI Components**
   - Abstract review interface
   - Batch review capabilities
   - Keyboard shortcuts for quick decisions
   - Export reviewed selections

### Phase 2: Full-Text Integration (Q2 2025)
**Goal**: Enable full-text article retrieval and analysis

1. **pubmed_retrieve_fulltext** tool
   - PMC API integration for open-access articles
   - DOI resolution for PDF URLs
   - Institutional proxy support
   - Fallback to abstract if full-text unavailable

2. **Content Processing**
   - PDF text extraction
   - Full-text storage in assets
   - Section identification (methods, results, etc.)
   - Figure/table extraction metadata

3. **Extended Extraction**
   - Update pubmed_extract_features for full-text
   - Section-specific extraction schemas
   - Reference extraction for citation tracking

### Phase 3: Iterative Workflow Support (Q3 2025)
**Goal**: Enable iterative research refinement

1. **Workflow Control Tools**
   - **evaluate_research_completeness**: Assess coverage of research question
   - **identify_research_gaps**: Find missing topics/perspectives
   - **suggest_query_refinements**: Propose new search strategies

2. **Conditional Hop Support**
   - Allow hops to branch based on evaluation results
   - Support "go back to step X" patterns
   - Track iteration history

3. **Research State Management**
   - Track search iterations
   - Maintain query evolution history
   - Link findings to specific searches

### Phase 4: Research Synthesis (Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Professional research output generation

1. **generate_research_report** tool
   - Multiple output formats (academic paper, summary, presentation)
   - Citation management (APA, MLA, Chicago styles)
   - Evidence synthesis with source tracking
   - Contradiction detection and reporting

2. **Bibliography Management**
   - Automatic bibliography generation
   - Citation graph visualization
   - Export to reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley)

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Completeness checking
   - Source diversity analysis
   - Methodology assessment

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (2026)
**Goal**: Research intelligence and collaboration

1. **Smart Recommendations**
   - Related article suggestions
   - Author network analysis
   - Trending topic identification

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Multi-user review workflows
   - Annotation sharing
   - Consensus building tools

3. **Research Analytics**
   - Literature gap analysis
   - Field evolution tracking
   - Impact prediction

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements
- Persistent storage for full-text articles
- Caching strategy for API calls
- Async processing for large documents
