Palatin Article Selection Mandate

Goal of Weekly Scientific Literature Alert

Palatin Technologies wishes to receive a Weekly Scientific Literature Alert. The purpose of the Weekly Scientific Literature Alert is to inform company personnel of the existence of newly published scientific and medical literature that highlights opportunities and risks relevant to Palatin’s Scientific Business Goals (defined below). The Weekly Scientific Literature Alert plays an important role in keeping the Palatin scientific and business team up-to-date on the latest scientific and medical research, enabling them to make informed decisions and stay ahead in their pursuit to develop novel therapies.

More specifically, Palatin wishes to maintain awareness of the scientific literature relevant to the therapeutic benefits the melanocortin molecular pathway in various disease outcomes related to Palatin’s Scientific Business Goals (defined below) and Palatin’s Ongoing Research Programs (defined below). The value of this awareness comes in the form of identifying evidence that will inform the direction and design of their ongoing research programs. For example, if a new study is published related to the role of the melanocortin pathway in the study of obesity (one of Palatin’s Ongoing Research Programs), this study might inform the study design or the competitive landscape related to Palatin’s Scientific Business Goals (defined below).

Databases to be Searched

Searches will be executed using two databases: 1/ The National Library of Medicine’s Pubmed Database; and 2/ Google Scholar.

Article Selection Process

On a regular basis, searches will be executed using the following keywords in Pubmed and Google Scholar. These searches are intended to provide a superset of articles to be evaluated by the LLM for inclusion in the Weekly Scientific Literature Alerts.

Melanocortin OR MCR1 OR MCR4
Female Sexual Dysfunction
Obesity
Dry Eye Disease
Glaucoma
Retinal Disease

The articles to be included in the Weekly Scientific Literature Alerts should be selected from the search results returned based on their relevance to Palatin’s Scientific Business Goals (defined below) and Palatin’s Ongoing Research Programs (defined below). Only the articles with a high degree of relevance to Palatin’s Ongoing Research Program should be selected for inclusion in the Weekly Scientific Literature Alert.

Palatin’s Scientific Business Goals

Palatin Technologies is a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on developing novel therapies targeting the melanocortin pathway in the treatment of obesity, ocular disease, and gastrointestinal disease. Palatin’s corporate presentation is provided source material to provide overall context on Palatin’s business goals, which can be used to inform which articles should be included in The Weekly Scientific Literature Alerts and which articles should receive prominence in those Alerts.

Palatin’s Ongoing Research Programs

Palatin is engaged in a series of scientific studies related to the following objectives:

Melanocortin pathways related to obesity and binge eating
Bremolanotide in conjunction with GLP-1 adjuvant therapy in the treatment of obesity
Novel once-weekly peptide MCR4 agonist in the treatment of multiple obesity indications
PL7737 Oral small molecule MCR4R agonist in multiple obesity indications

MCR agonists in the treatment of ocular disease
Therapeutic pathways related to reducing inflammation related to dry eye disease
PL9643 MCR Agonist in the treatment of dry eye disease (DED)
PL9588 MCR Agonist in the treatment of glaucoma
PL9654 MCR Agonist in the treatment of retinal diseases

MCR agonists in the treatment of gastroenterology and renal disease
PL8177 Oral MC1R Agonist in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC)
MCR Agonist in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy

Melanocortin pathways in the treatment of sexual dysfunction
Palatin Technologies sold its female libido drug Vyleesi (bremelanotide) for the treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) to Cosette Pharmaceuticals for up to $171 million in December 2023. 


Palatin received $12 million upfront and is eligible for potential sales milestones. Therefore Palatin continues to have some business interest in melanocortin pathways in the treatment of sexual dysfunction based on its sales milestones; however because Palatin no longer controls the asset, there is very little activity in this research area.


Palatin retains rights to bremelanotide for other indications, such as obesity and male erectile dysfunction (ED).

The information in this section comes from Palatin’s website, which should be utilized to make determinations about article selections for inclusion in the Weekly Scientific Literature Alert.

Guidelines to Making Article Selections for Inclusion in the Weekly Scientific Literature Alert

Each week, the most relevant articles should be selected for the Weekly Scientific Literature Alert based on their relevance to Palatin and their scientific rigor based on the Evidence Hierarchy. 

The following criteria should be utilized to rate each article:
Develop a scale of 1 - 10 based on Relevance to Palatin Ongoing Research Program (defined above)
Develop a scale of 1 - 10 based on evidence hierarchy
Develop an Integrated Score based on above two scores
Integrated Score should weight Relevance to Palatin Ongoing Research Program 50% more than Evidence Hierarchy
Articles with an Integrated Score greater than 7, should be included in Weekly Scientific Literature Alert 
Keep total number of articles selected to under 10 per week, unless there are an unusual number of highly relevant articles
Perhaps develop some type of feedback mechanism that can be used to evaluate and tweak the algorithm

Note: The above are my initial thoughts related to the approach that the System should implement. They are intended to provide you with a starting point. I assume you will refine and iterate. We can discuss.
