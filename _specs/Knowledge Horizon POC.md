# Knowledge Horizon: Proof of Concept Specification

## Overview

Knowledge Horizon is an AI-powered horizon scanning application for executives who need to stay current on industry developments. The system intelligently onboards users, automatically configures personalized information pipelines, and delivers synthesized periodic reports.

**Core Philosophy:** Selective transparency and control - users can operate on autopilot or engage at any checkpoint to provide guidance.

## POC Scope & Goals

### What We're Building

A functional end-to-end system demonstrating:
1. AI-driven onboarding that requires minimal user input
2. Automated research, profiling, and mandate generation
3. Intelligent source selection and retrieval strategy configuration
4. Test run validation with sample report
5. Scheduled report delivery and web-based report inbox
6. Basic feedback mechanisms

### What We're Validating

- **Can AI effectively understand user context from minimal input?**
- **Can automated curation match manual setup quality?**
- **Will executives find synthesized reports valuable?**
- **Does selective transparency resonate with users?**

### Target Users for POC

5-10 pharma/biotech executives responsible for:
- Drug development strategy
- Competitive intelligence
- Scientific and regulatory monitoring

---

### 3. Curation Mandate Generation

**What It Is:** A structured document describing what information to prioritize

**Mandate Components:**
- Primary focus areas (topics, therapeutic areas, technologies)
- Secondary interests
- Competitive intelligence targets
- Regulatory focus areas
- Scientific domains
- Explicit exclusions

**Example:**
```
Primary Focus: Novel immunotherapy for solid tumors (lung cancer, melanoma). 
Track CAR-T, bispecific antibodies, checkpoint inhibitor combinations.

Regulatory: FDA oncology guidance, breakthrough designations, accelerated 
approval pathways.

Competitive: Monitor Competitor A Phase III trials, Competitor B partnerships, 
emerging immuno-oncology biotechs.
```

**Transparency Options:**
- **Autopilot:** AI generates, shows summary
- **Guided:** User reviews and edits full mandate
- **Custom:** User collaborates with AI to write mandate

**Duration:** Instant generation + 3-5 minutes review

---

### 4. Source Identification

**AI selects 15-30 optimal sources across:**
- Scientific journals (specialty journals relevant to mandate)
- Preprint servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv)
- Regulatory sites (FDA, EMA, health authorities)
- Clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Industry publications (FierceBiotech, Endpoints News, BioPharma Dive)
- Company news and press releases
- Conference proceedings (ASCO, ASH, etc.)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Relevance to mandate
- Update frequency
- Content credibility
- Accessibility

**Transparency Options:**
- **Autopilot:** System selects automatically
- **Guided:** User sees proposed sources with rationale, can modify
- **Custom:** User adds/removes specific sources

---

### 5. Retrieval Strategy Configuration

**For each source, system develops:**
- **Search queries:** Keywords, Boolean operators, domain-specific terms
- **Filters:** Date ranges, article types, relevance thresholds
- **Ranking logic:** Priority rules (e.g., Phase 3 > Phase 2, high-impact journals)
- **Update frequency:** How often to check source

**Example:**
```
Source: ClinicalTrials.gov
Query: ("immunotherapy" OR "CAR-T") AND ("lung cancer" OR "melanoma") 
       AND Phase="Phase 2|Phase 3"
Filter: Updated in last [timeframe]
Ranking: Phase 3 prioritized, enrollment > 100 patients preferred
Check frequency: Daily
```

**Transparency Options:**
- **Autopilot:** System configures everything
- **Guided:** User sees high-level strategy summary
- **Custom:** User can modify queries, filters, ranking per source

---

### 6. Test Run & Sample Report

- Full pipeline execution: retrieve, filter, rank, synthesize
- Generate sample report

**Report Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - High-level overview of key developments
   
2. **Key Highlights** (5-7 bullets)
