  The Core Insight

  Current Approach: We analyze each topic, extract multiple specific concepts with entity-relationship
  patterns, and create targeted queries for each concept. This creates many narrow searches.

  The Problem:
  - We're only searching one week of literature
  - Even specific searches won't generate massive volumes over just a week
  - Managing many concepts is complex
  - False negatives (missing relevant papers) are worse than false positives (reviewing some irrelevant
  papers)

  Alternative Strategy You're Proposing

  Instead of: "Let's cover topic X with concepts A, B, C, and topic Y with concepts D, E, F"

  Ask: "Can we find one or two very general searches that capture EVERYTHING in this semantic space?"

  Example:
  - Semantic space about: genomics, asbestos exposure, mesothelioma
  - Instead of 6 nuanced concepts with entity-relationship patterns
  - Just search: (asbestos OR mesothelioma)
  - This broad net will capture everything relevant
  - Over one week, this won't be overwhelming
  - Better to review some false positives than miss papers with overly narrow searches

  Key Points

  1. Time window matters: One week of papers is inherently limited in volume
  2. Coverage over precision: Better to cast a wider net and filter manually than miss relevant work
  3. Simplicity: One or two general searches are easier to manage than many specific ones
  4. Not a replacement: This is an ALTERNATIVE PATH - another strategy option, not replacing the existing
  concept-based framework

  The Question to Ask

  Given a semantic space, can we identify one or a few maximally general searches that guarantee coverage of
   all topics, accepting that we'll need to filter some false positives?
